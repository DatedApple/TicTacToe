# TicTacToe for 1 and 2 players

These program will be based on the tutorial in Robert Heaton's posts [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/) as well as [The Coding Train's Coding Challenge #154](https://youtu.be/trKjYdBASyQ?si=VxArqHAyYAkpH7pY). The end result should be a functional TicTacToe game with a functioning AI able to play the game and functionality for 2 players.

The code will be using the Minmax algorithm to determine the AI's moves and uses a 2D list in order to store the game data.

This is a learning project, so a lot of the project will be either buggy or redundant, so feel free to reach out on possible changes and implementing them if you want to.
# Setup

Right now, this is just two Python files, so you really just need Python on your computer
